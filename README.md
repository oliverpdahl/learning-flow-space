# Daloy Learning Flow

Daloy learning flow is a react web app that helps learners stay on track and in control of their learning without the need for an instructor. It contains embeded learning resources that can be toggled between keeping users from getting distracted while going between resources and finding something else to do. It also allows learners to see who else is active and see their focus level, creating a peer insentive to stay on task. Finally, it allows users to see their own focus level as well as the amount of time that they have been active for during the session.
